      "text": "VIDEO | Mumbai: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aditya Thackeray spoke on the language debate in Maharashtra, saying: “There are some biased media outlets, what we call godi media, is creating this controversy. Otherwise, there is no real controversy in Maharashtra regarding Hindi or Marathi. The only issue raised was about why Class 1 children are being burdened with three languages.
