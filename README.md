This Data Scrapping Consist of Python file where we are using the twitter account login credentails. 
We can scrap any users details without having the login in the twitter. 
but if want to scrape the comments of any post then users required the login. 
Using the python selenium package we started scraping the data. 
this projects need the details where the one .csv file is required where we need to paste all the url from which we had to scrape the data. 






1. Checking that how many of the json have the 0 comments 
-- this is because some url data scrapping failed -- so repeating again to get the data of these url again.
2. Data Cleaning
-- removing the duplicates comments and the unreadable unnecessary comments.
3. complete raw data prepared. 
4. Keybords finding 
5. best model for the analysis.  -- choose
6. then figuring out the analysis things what we required 
7. based on the requirement witing the prompt and get the output.
8. graph making 
9. then bert model using for the analysis output. 
10. 




 Finalize keyword & date range
 1. find the frequency of the hashtag and frequent word from the output list.
 2.

# Twitter/X Comments Scraper and Processor

This project consists of two main Python scripts that work together to scrape and process comments from Twitter/X posts. The scripts are designed to handle multiple URLs and provide robust error handling and checkpoint saves.

## Features

- Automated Twitter/X login
- Scrapes comments from multiple Twitter/X posts
- Handles rate limiting and spam warnings
- Checkpoint saving to resume interrupted scraping
- Progress tracking for processed URLs
- Comment deduplication
- Comprehensive error handling
- Data processing and Excel export

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Chrome Browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)
- Required Python packages:
  - selenium
  - pandas
  - openpyxl

## File Structure

- `twitter_scraper_new.py`: Main scraping script
- `process_comments_new.py`: Comment processing script
- `DataPaper.csv`: Input file containing Twitter/X URLs to scrape
- `chromedriver`: Chrome WebDriver executable
- Various JSON files: Scraped comments for each URL
- `twitter_comments.xlsx`: Final processed output file

## Setup

1. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium pandas openpyxl
   ```

2. Download ChromeDriver that matches your Chrome browser version and place it in the project directory.

3. Create a `DataPaper.csv` file with Twitter/X URLs (one URL per line).

## Usage

### 1. Scraping Comments

Run the scraper script:
```bash
python twitter_scraper_new.py
```

The script will:
- Prompt for Twitter/X login credentials
- Process each URL from DataPaper.csv
- Save comments in JSON files
- Track progress in processed_urls.json

### 2. Processing Comments

After scraping, run the processing script:
```bash
python process_comments_new.py
```

The script will:
- Process all JSON files in the directory
- Combine and organize the data
- Generate an Excel file with processed comments

## Output Files

- Individual JSON files for each processed URL (`channelname_comments_conversationid.json`)
- `processed_urls.json`: Tracks which URLs have been processed
- `twitter_comments.xlsx`: Final processed data in Excel format

## Error Handling

The scripts include robust error handling for:
- Network issues
- Rate limiting
- Spam warnings
- Page loading problems
- Scroll failures

## Checkpointing

The scraper implements checkpointing to:
- Save progress every 20 comments
- Resume from last position if interrupted
- Track processed URLs
- Maintain scroll position

## Notes

- The scraper respects Twitter/X's rate limits with dynamic delays
- Comments are deduplicated during scraping
- The processor handles multiple data formats and edge cases
- Progress and errors are logged to the console

## Limitations

- Requires manual login credentials
- Subject to Twitter/X's rate limiting and anti-bot measures
- May need adjustments based on Twitter/X UI changes
- Processing large numbers of comments may be time-consuming

## Best Practices

1. Run the scraper with stable internet connection
2. Monitor the process for any rate limiting issues
3. Back up JSON files before processing
4. Review the Excel output for data quality
